# How to Use Tushare as a Data Source for OpenBB

**OpenBB**, as an open-source financial data platform, is dedicated to providing free and transparent financial data interfaces for investors, analysts, and developers. For a detailed introduction to OpenBB and its usage, please refer to [Introduction to OpenBB and How to Use It to Aid Financial Data Analysis of China A-share and Hong Kong Stocks](https://medium.com/@shugaoye/introduction-to-openbb-and-how-to-use-it-to-aid-financial-data-analysis-of-china-a-share-and-hong-f4bbe480399a).

Although OpenBB supports multi-source data interfaces, the acquisition of financial data in China (including Hong Kong) mainly relies on Yahoo Finance. As a free basic data source, it can meet basic needs, but its coverage depth for the Chinese and Hong Kong markets is still insufficient. More importantly, mainland Chinese users need to use a VPN to access this service, creating significant usage barriers.

To enhance service capabilities in Greater China, OpenBB urgently needs to improve the implementation of localized financial data sources. The mainstream paid solutions include Wind, Eastmoney Choice, and 同花顺 iFind (mainly for institutional clients), while the free solutions focus on the open-source tool Tushare or AKShare as the core solutions. Tushare has become one of the most comprehensive, up-to-date, and developer-friendly financial data libraries in the domestic Python ecosystem.

The `openbb_tushare` project, as a data source extension for OpenBB, enables seamless integration of Tushare data into the OpenBB platform. Below is a detailed usage guide:

## 💻 Environment Setup and Installation Process

As developers, we primarily interact with the platform through the OpenBB Platform CLI. To integrate the Tushare data source, follow these steps to configure the development environment:

1. **Create a Python Virtual Environment**

   You can use `venv`, `uv`, or `poetry` to create a virtual environment. Here, we use venv (built into Python):

   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment  
   python3 -m venv .venv  
   
   # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/Mac)  
   source .venv/bin/activate  
   
   # For Windows  
   .venv\Scripts\activate  
   ```

2. **Install OpenBB Platform CLI**

   Install the core OpenBB CLI via pip. Users in mainland China can configure a mirror for faster installation:

   ```bash
   # (Optional) Set a domestic mirror for pip  
   # For Linux/Mac  
   export PIP_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple 
   
   # Install OpenBB CLI
   pip install openbb-cli
   ```

3. **Install openbb_tushare**

   Next, install the `openbb_tushare` extenstion to use the Tushare data source:

   ```bash
   # Install the Tushare data source extension  
   pip install openbb_tushare  
   
   # Rebuild OpenBB resources to activate the plugin  
   python -c "import openbb; openbb.build()"  
   ```

## 🚀 Using the Tushare Data Source

### Case 1: Query A-Share Company News (Vanke as an Example)

**Jupyter Notebook**：

```Python
from openbb import obb
messages = obb.news.company("000002", provider="tushare")
for result in messages.results:
    print(f"{result.title}")
```

Output：

```plaintext
开源证券发布万科A研报，公司信息更新报告：销售均价有所提升，股东持续借款提供支持
万科A出售2086万股库存股，金额1.36亿元
万科A：已完成所有A股库存股出售 所得资金4.79亿元
...
```

**Using OpenBB CLI**：

```bash
openbb
2025 Jun 26, 03:11 (🦋) /news/ $ company --symbol 000002 --provider akshare
```

After entering the command, the results will be displayed in a WebView, as shown below：

### Case 2: Obtain Historical Stock Prices of Hong Kong Stocks (Hong Kong Telecom as an Example)

**Using OpenBB CLI**:

```
2025 Jun 26, 03:28 (🦋) /equity/price/ $ historical --symbol 06823 --provider tushare
```

Results in WebView：![openbb05](docs/images/openbb05.png)

**Jupyter Notebook**：

```Python
from openbb import obb
prices = obb.equity.price.historical(symbol='06823', start_date="2025-06-01", end_date="2025-06-10", provider="tushare")
prices.results[0].date, prices.results[0].open, prices.results[0].close, prices.results[0].high, prices.results[0].low, prices.results[0].volume
```

Output：

```
(datetime.date(2025, 6, 2), 11.28, 11.3, 11.3, 11.14, 10308375)
```
